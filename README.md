# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Vancouver City Dataset

## Project Title:
Infrastructure and Capital Works, Capital Expenditure, and Other Service Requirements of Vancouver City

## Objective:
This group project will build and deploy Data Analytics Platforms (DAPs) to answer descriptive and exploratory queries on datasets regarding Vancouver's infrastructure and economy.

## Dataset:
The dataset comes from Vancouver's Open Data site, specifically focusing on non-market housing. It includes affordable housing project characteristics such as:
- Name
- Location
- Type of housing
- Operator
- And more.

## Methodology:

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- **Data Loading:** To load the Vancouver City Dataset, Python modules such as Pandas will be used.
- **Data Cleaning:** Perform essential data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing values, changing data types, and renaming columns for better clarity.
- **Project Contributions:** The dataset involves business license cancellations, data intake, profiling, cleaning, and analysis. Every team member has contributed to the project, including the proposed and under-projects, and other essential components.

### 2. Data Visualization:
- **Geographical Mapping:** Plot the Vancouver City Dataset on a map to analyze the spatial distribution of non-market housing.
- **Bar Charts:** Create bar charts to show the proportion of different operators during the project's execution.

### 3. Insights and Findings:
The dataset will explore the equitable distribution of housing in Vancouver with the following questions:
- Which operators or dwelling types are the most common?
- Are there underserved locations for non-market housing?
