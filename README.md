# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Vancouver City Dataset

## Project Title:
Infrastructure and Capital Works, Capital Expenditure, and Other Service Requirements of Vancouver City

## Objective:
This group project will build and deploy Data Analytics Platforms (DAPs) to answer descriptive and exploratory queries on datasets regarding Vancouver's infrastructure and economy.

## Dataset:
The dataset comes from Vancouver's Open Data site, specifically focusing on non-market housing. It includes affordable housing project characteristics such as:
- Name
- Location
- Type of housing
- Operator
- And more.

## Methodology:

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- In order to load the Vancouver City Dataset, Python modules such as Pandas should be used.
-	Carry out fundamental data cleaning tasks in Vancouver City Dataset, such as resolving missing values, changing data types, and renaming columns in order to enhance clarity.
- The Vancouver City Dataset includes business license cancellations, data intake, profiling, cleaning, and data analysis, and every member of the team has contributed to the creation of the project, as well as the proposed project, the under-project, and other parts of the project.

### 2. Data Visualization:
- Create visualizations to illustrate key insights:
  - **Geographical Mapping:** Plotting the Vancouver City Dataset on a map to analyse the space of non-market housing and its spatial distribution.
- **Bar Charts:** Proportion of the different operators during the project running.

### 3. Insights and Findings:
The dataset will explore the equitable distribution of housing in Vancouver with the following questions:
- Which operators or dwelling types are the most common?
- Are there underserved locations for non-market housing?

## 4. Recommendations
Mapping of geographical areas shows that non-market housing should be strategically located in underserved areas in Vancouver in order to balance the accommodation levels throughout the city. It is advisable to authorize resources to those operators and dwelling sorts, which serve the most attractive segments, significant by demand. Sustaining and verifying all the information of the records about the houses being constructed. Employ analytical methods to support decision about infrastructure spending and assessing the outcomes of applied modifications. Also, provide for closer cooperation between operators and policymakers in identifying the housing accessibility deficits and better aligning projects to the community needs. The future studies should aim at better utilization of the analytics to incorporate the predictive modelling for future housing market demand.

## 5. Conclusion
This group project focuses on researching the infrastructure and economy of Vancouver using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset obtain from Vancouver’s Open Data related to non-market housing. The idea is to deliver a geographical study of affordable housing schemes, operators and inventory. The techniques that are used include data cleansing, descriptive analysis, and graphical representation including geographical map and bar graphs to gather information on the housing equity, operators and gap areas. The project is useful in discovering the spatial and operational characteristics of non-market housing in Vancouver for better planning and allocation of resources in a fair manner.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python**: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation:

- **Data Cleaning:**  
 This subfolder will include datasets that have been preprocessed, which means that the data has been cleaned and is prepared to be used in some type of study.

- **Data Profiling:**  
  This subfolder is intended to store datasets that have previously been prevalidated and are ready to undergo transformation or analysis.

- Python and Excel are two examples of data analysis tools that may be used to load the dataset.
In order to make better use of the analysis and datasets that are available via the AWS interface, as well as the solution that is provided by the S3 buckets. There are two types of data included inside this bucket: raw data and processed data. Data cleaning for the purpose of saving the profile reports and the data quality insights during the process of building the Non-Market-Housing-License-Cancellations folder in order to maintain the readiness of the analysis.
It has been determined that the CSV file that contains the tables in the Amazon S3 bucket has been processed for the Amazon Data Catalog.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics:
- **Summary Statistics for Key Variables:**  
  Calculate summary statistics for key variables, including:
  - To perform summary statistics, we have to count the possibilities of total number of operators of housing, types of housing, the groups of people they are addressed to in the given database. Thus, this analysis assists in evaluating the diversity and coverage of services and demographics of VMCH’s non-market housing projects in Vancouver.

### 3. Data Visualization:
- **Create Visual Representations to Illustrate Findings:**
  - **Geographical Mapping:**  
   Plotting the dataset on a map to analyse the space of non-market housing and its spatial distribution.
  
  - **Bar Charts:**  
   Proportion of the different operators during the project running.

### 4. Customer Segmentation:
  -	Basing the target customers upon their purchasing behavior allows determining frequent and occasional buyers, so proper approaches can be developed for both types of clients. As mentioned above, the high-frequency buyers may be appealed by the loyalty programs or the special offer, while the low-level buyers may be appealed by the promotion initiatives. This analysis can reveal trends by the purchasing of certain type of housings or operator services that could benefit the improvement in allocation and better brand offering.

### 5. Insights and Findings:
From the dataset, the following key questions might be explored:
- **Equity in Housing Distribution:**  
  To what extent does the distribution of homes in the city reflect a sense of equity?
  
- **Most Common Dwelling Types and Operators:**  
  Which sorts of dwellings or operators are employed the most frequently?
  
- **Underserved Areas:**  
  Are there any places that are not being adequately supplied by the non-market housing?

### 6. Recommendations:
To ensure equity in Vancouver non-market housing, it is recommended to take place the analytic approach and define which zones in the city are underserved. Perform detailed explorations of geographic space and identify specific locations that might be underserved in terms of housing choice; then cross-reference these results with other data about population needs to learn more about the populations most people in those areas are likely to be. Promote threshold contracts with a wider assortment of operators so that various services involving seniors, families, and homeless people can be offered. Apply the forecasting technique because it helps in determining future demand to inform the CapEx for 2026 and beyond. Call for collaborative efforts on the part of the government to encourage the construction of all types of housing which are not evident in existing projects. Encourage more production of non-market housing in identified areas by enhancing the policies supporting it and, at the same time, simplifying the regulatory framework to enhance the rate of project delivery. Timely datasets should always be kept for further tracking and monitoring; this provides clear decision-making. In other words, through optimal matching of the type of resources and policies that Vancouver offers to its residents based on the conclusions derived from the best analysis of available data, Vancouver stands to enhance the kind of housing market ecosystem that is available in the city.

### Tools and Technologies:
The data manipulation and the statistical analysis are in this project done with the help of **Python** libraries such as **Pandas and NumPy**, while the data visualization and the creation of the informative graphics and charts, are done with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. This program is used for purposes of first data cleansing and simple analysis. **AWS** solutions are employed to work in the **cloud** and **S3** for storing unprocessed and processed data and the Data Catalog for keeping aware of datasets. These technologies allow for the fast and large-scale handling of data, data analysis and data visualization, making the different EDA and decision-making processes easily scalable and extendable.

There is available and open dataset for further analysis about the non-market housing within the area of jurisdiction of Vancouver. It embraces details of the facilities such as the name address and type of facility, the operator and any other relevant detail on affordable housing. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes data overview involving data summaries, distribution of data, check of the extent of missing data, and data graphics. Housing distribution is analyzed same as above and the various points related to it for ascertaining the dominant operators and to identify the areas which are not properly served by the existing operators using the given dataset. The data is categorized as temporary modular housing and are structures which cannot be fixed on the land and which can be built in a few months. Specifically, the dataset is updated weekly and has maintained data accuracy; however, some data may be missing because of synchronisation and data entry problems.
